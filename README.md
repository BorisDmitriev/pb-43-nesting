#### 1. 2D Array
* Given the 2D Array below, **loop** through the arrays to print the values.

```javascript
let board = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  ["quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "lazy", "dog"],
  [true, false]
];
```

#### 2. Doggo
* 2.1 Create an object called doggo. Add name and breed as properties of the object.
* 2.2 Create an array within the doggo object named `favoriteFoods` and add the doggo's favorite foods to the array.
* 2.3 Access the second element of the doggo's favorite foods. 
* 2.4 Add a method called `showFavorites` that loops through and print all the doggo's favorite food.

#### 3. Recipe
* 3.1 Create an object called recipe. Add name and preparition time as properties of the object.
* 3.2 Inside this object, you should create another object for ingredients and store ingredients as properties butter, sugar, flour etc. Each property should have a string as its value. Example:
  ```js
     {
      butter:'butter' 
     }
  ```
* 3.3 Without changing the previous code, add another ingredient - let's add `ginger`. 
* 3.4 Change the value of ingredient `ginger` to `grated ginger`. 
* 3.5 Write a method in the recipe object called `showIngredients` that prints the value of each ingredient in the ingredients object.
